Go & SDL2 >> Isometric Dungeon Generator
NOTE: That this will not work just by building, the SDL2.dll file, SDL2_image.dll file and SDL2_ttf.dll files must be in the working directory. Unfortunately the SDL2_ttf.dll file is too large to upload to GitHub so you will need to get it here https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf/releases. Just download the package, open the archive and copy only the SDL2_ttf.dll into the working directory (where all the other files of the program are). Once you have the file then you should be able to build and run the program.

Created with the SDL2 bindings for Go here https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2
